# RealFilament/ FlexiSmart -Slic3rSettings

Here I share my configs of my 3d Printer with the Real Filament (PETG) brand and the FlexiSmart TPU brand, cause there are hard to find.
It a lot of trail an error to get it right.

Be aware, that every printer is dirrent not only in brand but also in bulding so the values will never be a 100% fit. But this fits MY Prusa i3 MK3 the best.

## What?

Its hard to find the perfect settings for filament online. Its even harder, to find setting for the "Real Filement" brand as it is some kind of Noname. Same goes for FlexiSmat (Their factory Settings are just a start and did not work for me at all.)

But that has is advantages like a lower price and still very good quality.

So here is it: My Configs for Slic3er.

PET-G (Polyethylene terephthalate) is a very strong, water-repellent material that gives your 3D-prints a beautiful shine. Most people are already familiar with PET as soda bottles. PET-G filament is rapidly increasing in popularity within the 3D-print community because it has the easy characteristics of PLA and the strong durability of ABS.
