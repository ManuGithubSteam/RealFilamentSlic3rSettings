# Slic3r/ PrusaSilcer Settings - especially for the Volcano Hotend with a 0.4 Nozzle

Here I share my configs of filament for my 3d Printer Prusa i3 Mk3s with different brands and functions, cause there are hard to find on the net. Especially if you want a Volcano Profile for a 0.4 nozzle.


It is a lot of trail an error to get it right. So i want to share my starting points.

Be aware, that every printer is dirrent not only in brand but also in bulding so the values will never be a 100% fit. But this fits MY Prusa i3 MK3 the best.

## Why?

Its hard to find the perfect settings for filament online. Its even harder, to find setting for a Volcano with a 0.4 nozzle. Few people seem to use this combination. Everyone seems to use bigger nozzles with the Volcano but you dont have to, to get more print speed and keep the same quality.

But that has is advantages like a keeping the 0.4 quality and still get print speeds increasing up to 50%.

So here is it: My Configs for Slic3er/PrusaSlicer with a Volcano hotend and a 0.4mm nozzle. 

## How much improvement are we talking?

Here i made some statistics and some pics. This is a 100% benchy the 200% one is still printing....

Real World Example

Waving Groot 15,5cm (100% scale):

e3d v6: 701 min
volcano: 448 min

-> 36% increase in print time.

Corner Join piece from a friend:

e3d v6: 722 min
volcano: 262 min

This is just mental!
